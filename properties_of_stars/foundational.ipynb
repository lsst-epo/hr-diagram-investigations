    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you will be using a data visualization tool called the [H-R Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung–Russell_diagram), first developed more than a century ago by [Ejnar Hertzsprung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejnar_Hertzsprung) from Denmark, and [Henry Norris Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell), an American. The H-R Diagram will enable you to create your own \"window\" to the stars and explore what it can reveal about star properties such as size, temperature, and energy output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accurately compare stars to each other and measure properties such as their energy outputs, it is important to account for the fact that two stars of the same brightness will look very different if one is farther away from Earth than the other. One way to address this issue is to collect data from a group of stars in a [star cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster), in which all the stars are the same distance away. Today you will collect and analyze data for the stars in one cluster, which will allow you to determine the variation that exists in stellar properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this investigation, the term [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity) refers to the total energy output from a star per unit of time. Luminosity is typically reported as a ratio of the star's energy output compared to the energy emitted by the Sun. For example, a star with a _solar luminosity_ of \"10\" emits ten times more energy than the Sun.\n"
